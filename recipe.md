Steps / Instructions for the Cake:

1) Preheat the oven to 175Â°C. Butter the bottoms and sides then dust with flour, and tap out the excess.

2) Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl; set aside.

3) Beat the butter, sugar and oil in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla until combined.

4) Bake the cakes on the same oven rack until golden on top and the centers spring back to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes. Rotate the pans about halfway through if they seem to be browning unevenly. Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely.


Steps / Instructions for the Frosting:

1) While the cakes cool, beat the butter and salt in abowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in the icing sugar.

2) Once it's all been added, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until white and fluffy. Add 2 tablespoons of the milk, and beat to incorporate. Beat in the remaining milk, one tablespoon at a time (the frosting will be spreadable but not runny).
